Assignment 1 - Making a website
Website made for a band

The website was made for Roselia to give new fans general information on them,
an overview of their discography and to purchase tickets to their live shows.
The website is dedicated solely to Roselia, as the official website lists information for 6 other bands, so the website does not have a fixed theme.

I chose the band Roselia because it was the first band I thought of upon being given the assignment, and also because I know Roselia well enough to write about them without needing to copy paste information from external sites too much.

The website was based off the official website for Bang Dream!, simplified due to
time constrains. The main colour for the layout for dark blue (#3344AA) as it is Roselia's main colour. 
As the official website hosts all 7 bands in the franchise, it does not have a specific theme to it. I made the website to focus specifically on Roselia, so it contains Roselia's elements. 

The main functions of the website are the 'About' page, discography overview and purchasing live show tickets
The 'About' page gives viewers a simple introduction to Roselia, both the in-game band and the real-life band
The 'Music' page gives an overview of Roselia's singles and albums, showing all the songs an album has in a pop-up window.
The 'Live Shows' page shows what lives are upcoming/ongoing and provides an option to purchase tickets for the show.
The 'Purchase' page enables consumers to purchase tickets
The user stories that inspired these functions were:
    - As a new fan, I would want to find out more about the band i am interested in.
    - As a user, I would want to easily navigate the band's website to easily find what  i need
    - As a band manager, I would want the band's music to be easily accessible to fans
    - As a consumer, I would like to be able to easily buy tickets

A function I wanted to implement was a seating booking along with the ticket purchase, but that was scrapped due to time constrains

The website was made by utilising functions of HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
Mainly HTML and CSS functions since I'm not as familiar with JS yet
